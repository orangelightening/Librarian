# Fetchers Overview

> Overview of the different fetchers available in Chonkie

Fetchers connect different data sources to Chonkie's pipeline system, enabling seamless data ingestion from various sources.

## What are Fetchers?

Fetchers are the first step in the CHOMP pipeline (CHef -> CHunker -> Refinery -> Porter/Handshake). They retrieve data from different sources and pass it to the next pipeline stage for processing. Fetchers make it easy to:

* Load files from local storage
* Fetch documents from cloud storage (coming soon)
* Retrieve data from databases (coming soon)
* Connect to APIs and web sources (coming soon)

## Installation

Fetchers are included with the base Chonkie installation:

```bash  theme={"system"}
pip install chonkie
```

## Using Fetchers in Pipelines

Fetchers integrate seamlessly with the Pipeline API:

```python  theme={"system"}
from chonkie.pipeline import Pipeline

# Single file
doc = (Pipeline()
    .fetch_from("file", path="document.txt")
    .process_with("text")
    .chunk_with("recursive", chunk_size=512)
    .run())

# Directory with multiple files
docs = (Pipeline()
    .fetch_from("file", dir="./docs", ext=[".txt", ".md"])
    .process_with("text")
    .chunk_with("recursive", chunk_size=512)
    .run())
```
